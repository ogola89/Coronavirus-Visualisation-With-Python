    "Coronavirus has spread rapidly across the globe since it's first outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in the beginning of January 2020. On 30th January reported more than 9000 people has been infected, with total deaths 213. The virus has been spreading outside China, and infections have been confirmed in France, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Italia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Nepal and many more. No one knows when it will over, in fact the number of confirmed cases are growing day to day.\n",

    "We will see how to create a simple application to track the Coronavirus spreading using Python. At this end of this tutorial we will get a html page that shows a map with infected locations, including a slider to track the virus spreading based on date like in the figure below. For this tutorial I'm using Python 3.7, Pandas, Plotly 4.1.0 and Jupyter Notebook.\n"

If no error appear, then all required libraries already properly installed. Otherwise check Plotly and Pandas official page for installation instruction and further information. If you don't have Jupyter notebook on your personal hardware, I suggest to use Google Colab, which provide it on the cloud."
